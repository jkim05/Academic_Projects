		<h3> Blockchain </h3>
		
		<p class="title"> Ethical and Social Implications </p>
		<p class="tab"> There are security benefits of blockchain technology, but there are also disadvantages to its adoption. The costs for computational power do not outweigh the money users save on transaction fees using blockchain. Bitcoin “mining costs exclusive of hardware expenses are about $5,000~$7,000 per coin (Conway, 2020). Bitcoin’s system can only manage about seven transactions per second marking it as inefficient for speedy transactions. The main ethical issue referring to bitcoin and blockchain is use for illegal activity. Confidentiality works to protect users from hacks and preserve privacy (Conway, 2020). Criminals use this confidentially and security to proceed with illegal activities. This puts blockchain and bitcoin in an ethical situation, even though cash has always been a form of untraceable currency. </br> </p>
		<p class="tab"> Although, confidentiality and anonymity can also aid illegal activities. Silk road, known as part of the ‘dark web’, was a site that utilizes blockchain technology solely for the anonymity and security. This site was known as a drug marketplace and allowed users to purchase illegal items using bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies. Law enforcement shut down the site in 2013, but that did not prevent or deter the illegal marketplace. One year later, another site known as Silk Road 2.0 sprouted and this shows that illegal activity will not stop. “Many have argued that the good uses of crypto, like banking...,outweigh the bad uses of cryptocurrency, especially when most illegal activity is still accomplished through untraceable cash” (Conway, 2020). There will always be illegal activities and the negative stigma behind bitcoin’s use within an illegal marketplace may cause blockchain to not be popular. Implementation of blockchain technology into society is on the rise and illegal trading will not deter this new concept. </br> </p>
