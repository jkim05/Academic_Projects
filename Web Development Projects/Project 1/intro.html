		<h3> Blockchain </h3>
		
		<p class="title"> Introduction </p>
		<p class="tab"> The concept of peer to peer transaction is now a reality with blockchain. The core concept of blockchain is to create an easily accessed, filtered, and manipulated and easily by any number of users at once (Conway, 2020). Blockchain is utilizing servers to store data allows for increased storage capabilities, computational power, and simultaneous users. Bitcoin’s implementation of blockchain may be able to shed a light on how it will change the distributed ledger technology and much more. Focusing on Bitcoin’s use of this technology will assist in the explanation of  how blockchain works, the security aspects, social, and ethical implications. Benefits of blockchain include greater trust, greater security, and more efficiencies (“What is blockchain technology”). Through less wasted effort on record-keeping systems, limited transparency, and the arrival of internet of things. Businesses are seeking the ability to be able to access data quickly, securely, and verify the correct users. This is what blockchain has to offer in the realm of secure data storage. </p>
	
		<p class="title"> Background </p>
		<p class="tab"> There are five basic principles of blockchain technology: 1. Ensure that both parties on a blockchain has access to the database and history, 2.  Direct communication between parties and that nodes store and advance the information to the rest, 3. Every transaction and details of the transactions are visible to anyone with access, 4. The inability to alter records or transactions once that have been completed, 5. users may set up algorithms and rules that can cause automated transactions between nodes (Iansiti & Lakhani, 2017). Block chain is like an encrypted Excel sheet that keeps track of transactions. Each transaction is automatically approved by a decentralized system that runs the transaction code. This code is then recorded into a database and each record is known as a block. “Linked together using a single list, called a chain” (Tan et al., 2020). This list is then certified through computers, known as miners. These miners are connected to the internet and are now referred to as nodes. The miner engages in finding the best combinations, known as a hash, to stockpile the information. The nodes act as permeant data or save point and this allows for the information to be retained in the database pending proper verification. </p>
