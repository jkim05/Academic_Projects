		<p class="title"> Security Aspects </p>
	    <p class="tab"> There are four different types of blockchains, and each have different security aspects: 1. Public blockchain allow anyone to join and validate transactions, 2. Private blockchains are limited a single entity that controls membership, 3. Permission less blockchains have no restrictions on processors, 4. Permissioned blockchains are restricted to the users with proper certifications (“What is blockchain technology?”). Public blockchains allow for users to participate anonymously, while private blockchains rely on confirmation of identity and the proper privileges. The crucial objective of any blockchain application is assessing which type of network is required to meet the user’s goals. </p>
		<p class="tab"> Hackers are kept at bay due to the blockchain infrastructure. “Let’s say a hacker wants to alter the blockchain and steal Bitcoin from everyone else. If they were to alter their own single copy, it would no longer align with everyone else's copy. When everyone else cross-references their copies against each other, they would see this one copy stand out and that hacker's version of the chain would be cast away as illegitimate” (Conway, 2020). Due to the chronological and liner order of how data is stored within blockchain. Hacker’s require vast amounts of money and resources to successfully steal bitcoins from other users. Since blockchain transactions have timestamps and hash codes to reference, hackers need to fix every discrepancy between copies and the legitimate ones. </p>
		<p class="tab"> There has been a new case study by Varioglu, from the University of Cincinnati, of a new cybercrime known as crypto jacking. “Cryptojacking is the unauthorized use of computers to mine cryptocurrency using malicious scripts” (Varlioglu, 2020). The attacker has the victim click on a malicious link, website, or advertisement; a crypto mining code penetrates the user’s computer and loads the crypto mining code. The program executes without the user’s knowledge and may cause slower computer performance. These types of attacks may also have capabilities to infect other devices or network. Browser-based cryptojacking began in 2017 and has affected over 10 million users. Hackers have found a way to repurpose ransomware into crypto mining components. </p>
